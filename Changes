---
version: 0.50
date:    2014-02-05
changes:

changes:
- Previous patch got misapplied.  Fixed now.  Close RT92595 again. ;)
---
version: 0.47
date:    2014-01-30
changes:
- Applied patch from Graham Ollis closing RT#92595.
  FreeBSD v10 uses the clang++ compiler, and so do we.
---
version: 0.46
date:    2013-10-29
changes:
- Add a newline before MODULE keyword to fix RT#89839(srezic).
---
version: 0.45
date:    2013-09-17
changes:
- Fix POD syntax errors.
- Remove TODO list from POD.
---
version: 0.44
date:    2013-05-17
changes:
- Add flocking to output file handling in CPP.pm and Makefile.PL to prevent
  race conditions that might occur during parallel testing.
  (Note, There are still race-condition issues in Inline that will affect
  us until they're fixed.)
---
version: 0.43
date:    2013-05-04
changes:
- Require Inline::C version 0.53 to mainstream the bug fix that addressed
  Inline's RT#11748, and Inline::CPP's RT#84762.
- No changes from 0.42_002 (dev) other than to bump the version number to a
  'production' number.
---
version: 0.42_002
date:    2013-04-24
changes:
- Require Inline::C version 0.52_02, to test a fix for the bug raised in
  Inline's RT#11748, and Inline::CPP's RT#84762 Typemaps were causing INC
  to be clobbered.  Though this may be an Inline::CPP bug, the simplest fix
  turned out to be a patch to Inline::C.
---
version: 0.42_001
date:    2013-04-24
changes:
- Added documentation on the Some::Foo::Foo problem (See the POD section,
  "The Perl Namespace Hack").
- Removed version number from README; fewer places to make a mistake.
---
version: 0.42
date:    2012-11-02
changes:
- POD enhancements. Explanation of what parts of C++11 do and don't map
  to Perl.  Better explanation of why templates don't work for Perl
  binding.
- POD enhancements. Example code for specifying compiler flags, and
  compiler version. CC, CCFLAGS.
- Fixed an error in the AUTO_INCLUDE documentation.
---
version: 0.41
date:    2012-09-05
changes:
- POD enhancements. Better description of compilation, _Inline/, and 
  code-reuse (modules, distributions).
---
version: 0.40_001
date:    2012-08-24
changes:
- '[ DEVELOPER'S RELEASE -- Changes to CPP.pm require smoke testing. ]'
- Added test to release test to test compile after wiping out pre-existing
  Inline config file.
- Added test for consistent version numbering.
- Added test to ensure 'LIBS' configuration directive wraps in an array-ref
- Converted all "author" type tests to run only with RELEASE_TESTING (some
  were already that way.  Just created better consistency).
- Bug-fix: library specification needed to be wrapped in an array-ref.
  Reported and tracked down by Paul Grinberg++.
---
version: 0.40
date:    2012-08-23
changes:
- Added META_MERGE => provides to Makefile.PL.
- Added another example to the POD (elipses, exceptions, overloading
  work-arounds).
- Added a RATIONALE section to the POD.
- POD enhancements, and clarification on reasons for Template and
  Overloading limitations.
- Added #define __INLINE_CPP 1 to all Inline::CPP generated code to
  facilitate preprocessor logic that targets Inline::CPP code.
---
version: 0.39
date:    2012-05-07
changes:
- All changes from 0.38_004 remain.
- Inline::CPP::Config is now the write target for Makefile.PL rather than
  directly writing to CPP.pm.
- Added 09pod_coverage.t and 10kwalitee.t tests.
- Major refactor for Inline::CPP::validate() and
  Inline::CPP::XS_bindings().
- Warnings added to all tests.
- Explicit mention of all dependencies (even core) in Makefile.PL.
- LICENSE tag added to Makefile.PL so that the license is properly
  identified in the META.* files.
- MINIMUM_PERL_VERSION tag used in Makefile.PL to take advantage of
  more modern META tags.
---
version: 0.38_004
date:    2012-04-16
changes:
- Revert Makefile.PL to 0.38_002 logic
  (remove ExtUtils::CppGuess dependency).
- Add Inline::CPP::Config.pm
- Makefile.PL now writes to Inline::CPP::Config.pm rather than
  directly to CPP.pm.
- Modify Makefile.PL to write to new configuration location.
- Modify CPP.pm to utilize Inline::CPP::Config.pm rather than expecting
  hard-coded defaults to be written directly to CPP.pm by Makefile.PL.
- Make t/08cppguess.t **optional**.
- Update MANIFEST.
- Improved how Makefile.PL specifies minimum Perl version.
- Makefile.PL now includes a CONFIGURE_REQUIRES directive for a version of
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker that will support important meta tags.
---
version: 0.38_003
date:    2012-03-24
changes:
- Makefile.PL rewritten to use ExtUtils::CppGuess.  THIS IS A PRELIMINARY
  TEST.  EXPECT PROBLEMS.
- t/08cppguess.t to provide diagnostic info regarding Makefile.PL rewrite.
---
version: 0.38_002
date:    2012-03-07
changes:
- Bug fix for a bug introduced in refactoring code within version 0.35.
  A hash slice got (wrongly) refactored as something else.  Fixed now.
- Fine tuned a few other recent refactoring issues.
---
version: 0.38_001
date:    2012-03-06
changes:
- Dropped in the re-written test suite that uses Test::More.  This more
  modern test suite facilitates greater introspection for each segment of
  C++ code, and should also be easier to extend and maintain.
- Removed Test.pm dependency from distribution.
- Shifted CPP.pm away from "use base 'Inline::C';" to "our @ISA =
  qw( Inline::C );" to better deal with the fact that one cannot "use"
  Inline::C.
---
version: 0.38
date:    2012-03-06
changes:
- Added a minimum version of Test.pm under BUILD_REQUIRES in
  Makefile.PL to get a good version of Test.pm for the test suite.
  This fixes an issue where someone uploaded an empty distribution
  to CPAN named Test as version 0.001.  The  minimum version set for
  Test.pm was core for Perl 5.6.0.
---
version: 0.37
date:    2012-03-05
changes:
- Backed 'strict' out of test suite; tests began failing randomly on
  *some* minority of platforms (inexplicably).  May be a Test.pm fault.
- Test suite lacks Perl::Critic compliance on the single issue of 'strict'
---
version: 0.36
date:    2012-03-04
changes:
- Some platforms were complaining from strictures in the test suite
  conflicting with Test.pm's plan() function.  This issue should now be
  resolved.
---
version: 0.35
date:    2012-03-03
changes:
- Additional code cleanup and improvements in Perl::Critic compliance.
- All patches present in 0.34_004, including code formatting, cleanup
  Perl::Critic compliance and escaping (where necessary), and Makefile.PL
  fixes to allow NetBSD, Solaris, and Darwin platform install success.
- Explicitly require minimum Perl version of 5.6.0.
---
version: 0.34_004
date:    2012-02-28
changes:
- Code formatting cleanup in CPP.pm and grammar.pm.
- All code now passes Perl::Critic level 5, including test suite.
- CPP.pm and grammar.pm are Perl::Critic level 4 compliant.
- New NetBSD patch from Chris Smith targeting better install success on
  that platform.
---
version: 0.34_003
date:    2012-02-24
changes:
- Add (untested) code to Makefile.PL to deal with NetBSD so that
  we can get a clean NetBSD install. EXPERIMENTAL in this version.
- Add check to CPP.pm to avoid a noisy warning about undefined value
  when user code includes a subroutine with 'void' as param list.
  (Note: This does NOT add 'void' as a valid param list type.)
- POD refinements.
---
version: 0.34_002
date:    2012-02-16
changes:
- Patch to Makefile.PL provided by smoke tester Steven Schubiger which
  allows module to successfully install on MirBSD systems. Thanks!
- Patch to Makefile.PL by Dave Oswald to allow successful install for
  Darwin OS by setting proper default libraries.
---
version: 0.34_001
date:    2012-02-09
changes:
- Patched Makefile.PL (as suggested by sisyphus) to better detect proper
  Solaris compiler (targeting Solaris 2.11 bug).

---
version: 0.34
date:    2012-02-06
changes:
- Carry all updates current in 0.33_010(Dev) to 0.34(Stable) for release
  to CPAN.
- Set minimum version for Inline and Inline::C dependency to 0.50 to
  take advantage of Inline patch that resolves the issue where smoke
  testers were unable to locate Parse::RecDescent dependency.
- POD revisions.
- Inline::CPP now needs minimum Perl version of 5.6.x
---
version: 0.33_010
date:    2012-02-03
changes:
- '[ Patch applied by David Oswald ]'
- '*** NEVER RELEASED ***'

date:    2012-01-30
changes:
- '[ Patches by David Oswald ]'
- Make sure that Parse::RecDescent loads ahead of Inline::C so that the
  smoke-testers incompatible @INC modifications won't cause smoke failure.
  - Add 17memberarray.t to the test suite to validate the new code that
    allows Inline::CPP to recognize arrays as class/struct data members.
---
version: 0.33_007
date:    2012-01-29
changes:
- '[ Test suite patches by David Oswald ]'
- If 00load_prereqs.t does successfully load Parse::RecDescent (which it
  always seems to do), output the location it was found so it can be
  compared to @INC.
---
version: 0.33_006
date:    2012-01-22

- Tweaks to the distribution framework.
---
version: 0.33_005
date:    2012-01-21
changes:
- '[ Added suggestion from sisyphus ]'

  target compiler supports namespaces and Standard headers.  This
  will assist users in writing compiler-agnostic or portable code.
---
version: 0.33_002
date:    2011-12-20
changes:
- '[ Patch submitted by BrowserUk, adapted by davido ]'

  MS-flavor compilers.
---
version: 0.33_001
date:    2011-12-19
changes:
- '[ Patch submitted by sysiphus, adapted by davido ]'
- Developer release to verify smoke tests without upsetting v0.33 stable.
- Reworked Makefile.PL and CPP.pm to test-compile a C++ program containing
  <iostream>.  On success we know that <iostream> style headers are ok.
  On failure we assume that headers should be <iostream.h> instead.
  Removed previous compiler-name based detection in favor of trial method.
---

date:    2011-12-08
changes:
- '[ Patches by David Oswald ]'

- Version of Inline::CPP and grammar.pm updated to 0.32.
- Adjustments to the POD for clarity.
- Makefile.PL now requires Inline v0.49 to take advantage of the
  patch there that eliminates M18 install errors for Inline plugins.
  This should eliminate the bulk of the smoke test issues.

changes:
- '[ Patches by David Oswald - davido@cpan.org ]'
- Updated Makefile.PL to include Parse::RecDescent to the PREREQ_PM

---
version: 0.30
date:    2011-11-13
changes:
