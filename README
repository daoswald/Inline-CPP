INTRODUCTION:

Inline::CPP -- Write Perl subroutines and classes in C++.

Inline::CPP lets you write Perl subroutines and classes in C++. You
don't have to learn XS or SWIG, you can just put code right "inline"
in your source.

Example:

   use Inline CPP => <<'END';

   class JAxH {
     public:
       JAxH(char *x);

       SV* data();
     private:
       SV *dat;
   };

   JAxH::JAxH(char *x) { dat = newSVpvf("Just Another %s Hacker", x); }
   SV* JAxH::data() { return dat; }

   END

   print JAxH->new('Inline')->data(), "\n";

When run, this complete program prints:

   Just Another Inline Hacker.

FEATURES:

Inline::CPP version 0.34 is a stable release.  There have been numerous bug
fixes since 0.33, mostly targeting installation and smoke test success.
Please refer to the Changes file in this distribution for a description of the
revisions since the previous stable release.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:

This module requires Inline::C.pm version 0.50 or higher to be installed.
It also uses Parse::RecDescent.

To install Inline::CPP do this:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

(On ActivePerl for MSWin32, use nmake instead of make.)
(On Strawberry Perl you may use dmake instead.)

As Makefile.PL runs you will be prompted for what C++ compiler and library to 
use.  Accepting the default should work in nearly every case (and if it 
doesn't, let me know).
