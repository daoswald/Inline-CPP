INTRODUCTION:

Inline::CPP -- Write Perl subroutines and classes in C++.

Inline::CPP lets you write Perl subroutines and classes in C++. You
don't have to learn XS or SWIG, you can just put code right "inline"
in your source.

Example:

   use Inline CPP => <<'END';

   class JAxH {
     public:
       JAxH(char *x);

       SV* data();
     private:
       SV *dat;
   };

   JAxH::JAxH(char *x) { dat = newSVpvf("Just Another %s Hacker", x); }
   SV* JAxH::data() { return dat; }

   END

   print JAxH->new('Inline')->data(), "\n";

When run, this complete program prints:

   Just Another Inline Hacker.

FEATURES:

Inline::CPP version 0.33_006 is a dev. release.  It focuses on documenting the
install issue relating to the Parse::RecDescent dependency.  See INSTALL
for details if you experience problems installing Inline::CPP.

The most recent stable release is 0.33.  Releases ending in _xxx are
experimental/developmental.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:

This module requires Inline::C.pm version 0.49 or higher to be installed.
It also uses Parse::RecDescent.

To install Inline::CPP do this:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

(On ActivePerl for MSWin32, use nmake instead of make.)
(On Strawberry Perl you may use dmake instead.)

You have to 'make install' before you can run it successfully.
You will be prompted for what C++ compiler and library to use.  Accepting
the default should work in nearly every case (and if it doesn't, let me know).

*** A note about pre-requisites: Parse::RecDescent ***

Some smoke testers are reporting that the automated install tools such as
'cpan' and CPANPLUS are not properly installing the prerequisite
Parse::RecDescent.  If you see the Inline::CPP test suite failing with a
message about Parse::RecDescent, try installing that module first,
independently of Inline::CPP.  Then Inline::CPP should install cleanly as
documented above.
