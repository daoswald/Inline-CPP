Installing Inline::CPP

For most installations, the following should be all that is necessary:

cpan install Inline::CPP

...or...

Download the distribution's .tar.gz file, unpack it into its own directory,
then repeat after me:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install


*** Note regarding Parse::RecDescent dependency ***

There seem to be a growing number of cases where the automated tools
such as 'cpan' and CPANPLUS fail to cleanly install Parse::RecDescent, which
is an important prerequisite for Inline::CPP

If you experience difficulty installing Inline::CPP where the test suite fails
with a message about Parse::RecDescent, install Parse::RecDescent first, then
go ahead and try installing Inline::CPP again.


--- Other considerations ---

At install time you will be prompted about what C++ compiler and accompanying
library to use.  Under most circumstances just accepting the defaults will
be fine.  The best possible situation is to use the same compiler (or
compiler family) as what was used to compile Perl.
